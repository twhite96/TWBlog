<p>My <strong>first ever podcast</strong> is live and available on SoundCloud. I am not certain how I am going to structure it, how I am going to write show notes every week, etc. but the shot in the dark is thrilling. I recorded the episode last night, accidentally deleted it in GarageBand, re-recorded, and edited it tonight for <strong>THREE HOURS</strong>. I have a screencast to do for another blog, some programming homework, and I need to study for a quiz I have for Human Biology Monday. This is my weekend? It feels like work! But it’s <em>awesome</em>.</p>

<p>Here it is!</p>
