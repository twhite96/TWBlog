Since there are posts like this going around on blogs like [The Zen of Programming](https://zen-of-programming.com/vs-code-setup) and [DEV Community üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª](https://dev.to/nickytonline/my-visual-studio-code-setup-2ima) so I feel like giving my üî• take.

## VSCode: Themes

My current theme is [Gloom](https://github.com/agirton/gloom) because it's pretty and has the best balance of contrast and coolness.

I also have the standard Monokai, [Cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2/), [nightowl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme), and [level-up-vscode-theme](https://github.com/leveluptuts/level-up-vscode-theme) which is my second favorite.

## Extensions

I have *a lot* of extensions. Let's just get that out of the way. I know I should delete a lot of them and I have. Just need to go *a little further*.[^1]:

## Final Thoughts

VSCode has come a long way from when I first tried it in 2015. I use it exclusively now, and am extremely happy with it and happy with my overall setup[^2].


[^1]: I just installed 6 more while writing this.
[^2]: Though I could get rid of some of these extensions.
