> It's been five years since I started this humble blog on the web.

In that time, I [started university](https://tiffanywhite.dev/2015/05/02/i-am-now-a-pitt-panther/) as an old head, [quit university](https://tiffanywhite.dev/2016/02/17/fear-loathing-anxiety-pittsburgh/) and [went back](https://tiffanywhite.dev/2016/05/08/pitt/).

[Got my first internship](https://tiffanywhite.dev/2017/11/15/i-am-doing-this-thing/), didn't get offered. [Made mistakes about React](https://tiffanywhite.dev/2018/05/19/react-reconciliation/), and [got hired for my first dev job](https://tiffanywhite.dev/2019/07/03/goal-completed/)[^1], and more.

It's been a wild ride.

This blog has been instrumental in getting me noticed, getting Twitter followers, and making connections in the industry, from the Big 5 to smaller companies.

It is my passion for tech that shines through the most here and I plan to continue writing here for another five years or until I get tired of talking.

*Five whole years y'all*.

Thanks for coming on this journey with me.

[^1]: Just recently got let go due to lack of work for me. Yyyyyyyep.
