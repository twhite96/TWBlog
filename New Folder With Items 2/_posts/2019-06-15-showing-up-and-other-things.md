In [my latest newsletter](https://buttondown.email/tiffanywhite/archive/2a9c037a-cdec-4feb-8d31-992c1f39c356), I posted about having a routine and *doing the work*.

It's been two months now, and that is basically what I've done. I don't code on weekends[^1]. I try to get 8-10 hours of sleep a night and I try to get up between 9am-10am to start my day.

I have never been one to stick to schedules but at some point, at some age, you really just are *too old* to burn the midnight oil, and as I prepare to interview more, I really *need* a defined schedule.

## Building projects, solving algorithms, and trying to find some consistency

I am currently working on a [a book finder app](https://github.com/twhite96/book-finder) called Rad Reads. A lot of the apps I am gearing up to build are from [App Ideas Collection](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) by [Florin Pop](https://twitter.com/florinpop1705).

I recently tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Building simple apps to throw up on my portfolio seems really‚Ä¶idk</p>&mdash; Tiffany White ü§®ü§î‚öõÔ∏è (@tiffanywhitedev) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiffanywhitedev/status/1139990376373202946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

What I meant by this is I felt that having something significant on your portfolio was the *best* way to showcase what you could do for employers.

I've gotten this advice *over* and *over* and *over* again.

This is why I started building [Check Yo Self](https://checkyoself.netlify.com/); I wanted a big app to show my technical chops.

It‚Äôs been two years and it still isn‚Äôt finished.

Which is why when I received the following tweets, I felt relief:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As an employer, super valuable though. It shows me what you think the best way to do something is, because you clearly honed it for presentation.</p>&mdash; üéÖSt. Nick GauthierüéÖ (@ngauthier) <a href="https://twitter.com/ngauthier/status/1139990947750731776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Better a bunch of simple apps on the portfolio than trying to build one huge all encompassing app and never finishing.</p>&mdash; Jack Harner but üéÉ S P O O K I E R üëª (@JackHarner) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackHarner/status/1140268736047439874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

While I don't need permission from anyone to do what I feel is best for me and my career, it felt good to know that I could relax and just *build stuff*.

## Things looking better everyday

I can't say too much but things are looking up. I know I've said stuff like this before but this time I really feel things are going to happen. I don't know; these things are always a shot in the dark. But I feel like this time I have a chance.

And even if it doesn't happen I've set myself up for success quite a bit lately. I should be good.

And shout out to my buddy [Mark Pearyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-pearyer) for his recent success in finding not one, but **two** dev jobs. We started at the same time and with patience and persistence he's gotten his payoff. Here's hoping I'll soon have mine.

[^1]: Broken this weekend. I did some algorithms and watched a YouTube video on algorithmic thinking in order to solve another algorithm but for the most part I haven't done *too much* coding.
