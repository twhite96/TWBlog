So this is a brief post about my intent for my career and prospects for myself.

I love web. But I don't want to be about that life.

The more I do software engineering, the more I fall in love with the challenge and the languages[^1]. Classical OOP is nice and diving into functional programming is the next logical step, with Java recently adding lambda functions and some other nice functional features.

## What About The Blog Name? What About JavaScript?

Still going to work JavaScript-- kind of can't avoid it. And the blog name is changing once again[^2]. I love JavaScript tooling and look forward to learning more about React, Node, Redux, etc. But my main focus is software engineering for now.

## Will You Go Into Web At All?

As a first job? Not sure. It's unavoidable at this point. Whether I do architecture or backend remains to be seen. I'd prefer to have some say over an interface because I like visual things, but I am not a good designer, and I don't want to learn how to design; that would take away from my main focus, programming. So getting better at Java for now is important to me. I will be finishing out Free Code Camp because I started it and I will also finish up my cousin's ecommerce site which uses PHP. But after that, it's software engineering all the way.

[^1]: Specifically Java, C, Swift, Go, and C++.
