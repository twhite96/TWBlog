Sometimes it's just easier to know thyself.

I was sitting in the bathroom, talking to myself[^1], reflecting on lots of details about my life and the past year.

One of the things I thought about and have been thinking about since I lost my job nearly a year ago, is just *how bad* a job I did of understanding myself.

## They tried to warn me
The guy who would become my boss briefly when I got the offer, said to me on the third interview:

> This is consulting. It's fast paced. You sure you can handle it as a first job?

I remember it as clear as day: it was in the middle of the summer, 2019. I was in my downstairs bathroom. I hitched a bit. 

> Fast paced for a first job

I quickly dismissed my hesitation and said, "yeah, sure, no problem. I can do it."

I could *not* do it.

To be fair to me, the company didn't do a good job of training me, they didn't let me fail to learn as they *couldn't*; everything needed to move and move fast, with little money to do it. I was out on an island, expected to take on the frontends of four projects with *zero* prior professional experience and they *knew this*. They knew I was a junior dev. And when I asked them why my title didn't reflect that, I got a really awful non-answer.

But if I had listened to my gut instincts, I wouldn't have taken it and I wouldn't be in the position I am in now.

## However.
I *also* wouldn't have realized my [known failure modes](https://github.com/twhite96/README#known-failure-modes) and the fact that [building projects](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tiffanyrwhite_learning-developer-programming-activity-6684281766250999808-aAvN) is greater than the tutorial feedback loops.

I wouldn't have gone wild and [rebuilt my porfolio from basically scratch](https://www.tiffanyrwhite.com). 

I wouldn't have jumped to a new language to build a [static site generator](https://github.com/twhite96/static-gen-ruby) in Ruby.

And I *most definitely* wouldn't have *[blatantly ripped off](https://github.com/twhite96/info-tiff-dev)* [Fidalgo Dev's FAQ site](https://info.fidalgo.dev/)

{% notice tip %}
üí° &nbsp; Have a general understanding of your skillset before applying for a job. No, you don't need *all* of the listed requirements, but make sure you've built something of note, preferrably *not* from a course tutorial, and added it to your GitHub or portfolio. It's important to know that while impostor syndrome is a real thing, sometimes you really just *aren't ready* for that first job yet, and that's okay. Keep working at it, get better, and when you *do* get an offer, you won't end up writing a post like this. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Depression, listlessness, and finding my way
I wrote a post on my personal blog explaining just where I am at, emotionally, mentally, and getting a bit into my past a bit.

I am not linking it here; it's far *too* personal for this particular blog, but suffice it to say, it's been a *real battle*. I know it has been for everyone, but not everyone has the past I do and the current healing of that past I am doing right now, jobless, in the middle of a pandemic, with a sick mom that I am taking care of.

There are times I don't get out of bed and I know I need to, I know I have to build projects, apply for jobs, LinkedIn posts, writing blog posts, etc but there are days I don't even know if I am going to survive let alone do any of *that*.

It's a hellscape right now, but somehow I manage. Somehow, we all are.
