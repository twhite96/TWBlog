<p>So talking with <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexGwartney">Alex Gwartney</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nickqueen">Nick Queen</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/joedayvie">Joe Dayvie</a> on <a href="http://developersoup.com/index.php/2015/09/04/episode-6-alex-and-nick-welcome-fellow-developers-joe-and-tiffany/">Developer Soup</a> podcast about my journey to becoming a web dev. We all discussed the technologies we were using; Alex and I were using JavaScript and Nick and Joe, Ruby.</p>

<p>Somehow we started discussing school as Alex and I are both students. We talked about Java in an academic environment and how they teach outdated tech. I half didn&#8217;t believe Alex&#8211; who wants to believe they are taking out loans to learn that you&#8217;re not getting up-to-date tech? </p>

<p>I went to school and we were talking about doing string concatenation with the + operator. When asking around on Twitter about it Craig, a guy in Pittsburgh who works as an engineer, showed me an <a href="http://javapapers.com/core-java/java-string-concatenation/">article</a> that states that using + to concatenate strings in Java is outdated (surprise!) and comes at a speed cost. I discussed this in my Code &amp; Supply <a href="http://www.codeandsupply.co/podcast/monthly-check-in-with-tiffany-white">podcast</a> segment.</p>

<p>This was talked about on Twitter among local devs. Seems it&#8217;s a good way to introduce a student to string concat, but that other ways are discussed as you move forward in schooling. But what about JavaFX for GUI apps? According to Alex, they don&#8217;t teach that. I&#8217;ll just have to wait and see.</p>
