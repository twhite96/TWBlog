So I started the Free Code Camp Bonfires. I am really being tested as far as algorithmically; how do you come up with a solution to this problem? I guess I got a chance to do this in class when I build these Java projects and do these little code snippet things for MyProgrammingLab. But the JavaScript really tested me in ways I didn’t think I could be, because I am actually conscious of the fact I am coming up with algorithms.

The first one was easy. The second one I needed serious help with. The third I did a ton of research on, and eventually came up with a solution. I am not sure if it is “eloquent” but it ran. What I am finding out is that the Bonfires, while they get harder, actually build upon skills you learned in the previous. So we are working with a ton of for loops and iterating over arrays, changing a string to an array, concatenating arrays, splitting them and splicing them to determine if words are palindromes and changing a sentence to Title Case.

I worked with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/marcusp619">Mark Pearyer</a> on the Title Case Bonfire. Our solution was not elegant but he took charge and didn’t use the Gitter chat or Stack Overflow. We worked straight from the MDN docs. I am thinking of using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scratch-js/alploljligeomonipppgaahpkenfnfkn?hl=en-US">Scratch js</a> to refactor the code we wrote and debugging it in the browser.

One of the things Mark taught me was using a console.log to get results as you’re iterating your project. I knew this was a thing, I learned it early at Codecademy but forgot it was in my toolkit. Will be doing that from now on.
<h3>This is Hard…</h3>

…As it should be. Programming isn’t easy. I’ve hit a bump, a snag, the honeymoon not as great as before but I still love it. I love it when my code <em>just works</em>. I may have had to iterate a million times and I may have introduced 10 more bugs than I had before in the source code but it is so worth it to see the end result.

Here is a gist of one of my solutions. You’re free to refactor.
