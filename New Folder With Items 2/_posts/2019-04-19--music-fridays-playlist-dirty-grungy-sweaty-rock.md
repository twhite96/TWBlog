If you were a teenager in the mid-nineties, I don't need to remind you of the amount of pessimism that occurred during that era; from Kurt Cobain[^1] going on rambling improvs like *Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flows Through the Strip* on the *Nevermind* B-side, to Chris Cornell[^2] crooning in *Black Hole Sun* on *Superunknown*, you know the air was dank and filled with sorrow.

So this playlist isn't different than most of the songs from that era; there's some Beck pre The Information in here, Sonic Youth, Hole, and 7 Year Bitch[^3].

It's loud and grungy and I thoroughly enjoy cleaning and lifting to it.

[^1]: RIP guy. You were one of the good ones.
[^2]: RIP also. First celebrity crush that wasn't really a celebrity in the grander sense of the word. His shirtless running around in the Outshined video really set my teenage hormones ablaze. Still, miss him a lot. His suicide hit really hard.
[^3]: RIP Mia. She was slain in Seattle in '95 and they have no clue who did it. She was the vocalist for 7 Year Bitch. Damn what an awful slate of deaths for this scene.
