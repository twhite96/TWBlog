I am thinking of starting another podcast.

Most of the shows will be 15 > minutes as I *really, really, really hate audio editing* and cannot afford a dedicated editor for a weekly, seasonal show.

I am also not sure if I’ll hop on the *S01E01* bandwagon or not. Seems it is all the rage in the podcast community but I am not certain it works for developer podcasts though one of my favorites works that way.

## On Developer on Fire

I recorded an episode of [Developer of Fire](http://developeronfire.com/). It will be out sometime at the end of the month or beginning of next year.
