Map is another higher order function that goes through an array and doesn’t discard it but instead transforms/mutates it.

Here, I’d like to get an array of all the names of the animals.

```js
const animals = [
  { name: ‘Catticus Finch’,  species: ‘cat’ },
  { name: ‘Peaches’,         species: ‘fish’ },
  { name: ‘Bobby’,           species: ‘dog’ },
  { name: ‘Lucifer’,         species: ‘cat’ },
  { name: ‘Beatrix’,         species: ‘rabbit’ },
  { name: ‘Cerulean’,        species: ‘fish’ }
];
```

Here’s how we would accomplish this with a for loop:
```js
var names = [];

for (var i = 0; i < animals.length i++) {
  names.push(animals[i].name);
}
```

The function `.filter` expects a boolean, but `.map` expects a callback function to return a transformed object it will push into a new array.

To return the names of each of the animals in code:

In ES5:
```js
var names = animals.map(function() {
  return animal.name;
});
```

In ES6:
```js
const names = animals.map(animal => animal.name);
```

You can use `.map` to return a subset of an array. Since it expects a callback to return an object, we can make new objects.

In ES5
```js
var names = animals.map(function(animal) {
  return animal.name + ‘ is a ‘ + animal.species;
});
```

In ES6
```js
const names = animals.map(animal => animal.name + ‘is a ‘ + animal.species);
```

## Easier Array Manipulation with Higher Order Functions

`.map()` and `.filter()` are just a couple of higher order functions you can use to manipulate and iterate over arrays.
