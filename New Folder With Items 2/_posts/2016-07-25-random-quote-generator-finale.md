So I am <em>finally</em> finished with the Free Code Camp Random Quote Generator. I can breathe a sigh of relief until next project.

I finished it at 1 am yesterday morning. I wasn’t going to sleep until it was finished and I didn’t. I tweaked it well into the morning, finally falling asleep after decompressing with <em>The Forensic Files</em> on Netflix around 4:30 am. I was so anxious and on this programmer’s high that I couldn’t sleep.

I shared it on Twitter and mentioned Free Code Camp and I got a lot of likes and retweets as Free Code Camp retweet it.

I took my design and existing code and reengineered it for what I needed it to do.
<h2>Learning While Building</h2>
So a funny thing happened while I spent my Saturday heads down, headphones on coding this thing for 7 hours:

<em>The more you build, the more you learn</em>.

This has been repeated to me many times. I was in a tutorial loop, partially because the gamification is so rewarding and also because I was afraid of making something broken and ugly.

My portfolio is super ugly. I have made it private on CodePen <sup><a id="ffn1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> and am thinking about making it a Portfolio 2.0 some time down the road.

I was so frustrated after I started it at the end of June because I would look at code and not understand what it did. My design was needlessly complicated, and I was just all over the place with it.

I went back to Treehouse after scrapping my design and taking a week and a half break from it. I worked on it here and there. But Saturday while working on it and looking at documentation and googling the hell out of my issues, I actually <em>understood</em> the API code I copied and reengineered it. I consulted the documentation for jQuery and decided on which methods and event handlers to use pretty much on my own.

I was proud of what I had done. While a lot of that code was not mine, I <em>made</em> it mine, my design, everything.
<h2>Looking Ahead to the Weather App</h2>
I am not sure I will have enough time between now and the start of the semester to work on the Weather app. I will be using the Forecast.io API because it is the most accurate <sup><a id="ffn2" class="footnote" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. Dark Sky and a few other apps use it so I want to give it a shot. I took all of Sunday off to decompress from the high of completing the Random Quote Generator. I am writing this article at 12:30 am and am getting a bit tired. I just wanted to share the progress I made as a developer and on the RQG. You can find it here: <sup><a id="ffn3" class="footnote" href="#fn3">3</a> </sup>
