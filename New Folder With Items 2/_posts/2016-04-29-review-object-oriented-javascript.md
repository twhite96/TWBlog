My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1519932501">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Great, quick read that will help any new or intermediate JavaScript or web developer get more familiar with OOP JavaScript.<br><br>The best parts of the book for me coincide with the things I am learning at Treehouse during their OOP JavaScript course in the full-stack JavaScript Track.<br><br>As far as the OOP nature of JavaScript. A lot of the syntax and ideas borrow heavily from Java and it is evident when I am writing in JS. Fortunately, the book stresses the Prototypal Inheritance of JavaScript instead of thinking about it in a Classical Inheritance type of way. Eric Elliott has already crooned the virtues of Prototypal Inheritance, which is a feature of JavaScript people either love or hate.<br><br>I learned a lot in this book, that really just gave me a slightly more in depth look into the stuff I was already learning. Having gone to Pitt for two semesters and taking CS classes, a lot the OOP stuff was familiar as Java is a Classical OOP language. But thinking about it in the JavaScript way was helpful. Four stars.
