So I went back through the Bootstrap additions and the jQuery course. Now I am building a tribute page to Carl Sagan as my front-end project.

I have all kinds of ideas. I am thinking of adding a couple of planets scattered throughout the page and when you click on one, a quote from Carl appears and the planet dims. Or if you even just mouseover the planet there is some jQuery magic happening where the <code>mouseover()</code> event makes the planet magnify sort of like this:

<img class="aligncenter" src="https://helloburgh.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/animated.gif" alt="mouseover" width="611" height="91" />

And then they would sort of dim when you moused over them <em>while</em> they magnified…or after.

So many ideas…
<h3>JavaScript Understanding the Weird Parts</h3>
I wrote a post on my <em>strictly</em> programming blog about coercion. I learned quite a bit about it from Tony Alicea, who made the course I picked up for $10 at Udemy (a <em>steal</em> at that price). His explanation was clear and the console examples made it easy to see what was going on.
