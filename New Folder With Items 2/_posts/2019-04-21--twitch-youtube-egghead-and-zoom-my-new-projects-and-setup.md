I *do* have a Twitch channel.

<iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?channel=sydmalicious78" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" width="620" style="height:350px!important"></iframe><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sydmalicious78?tt_content=text_link&tt_medium=live_embed" style="padding:2px 0px 4px; display:block; width:345px; font-weight:normal; font-size:10px; text-decoration:underline;">Watch live video from Sydmalicious78 on www.twitch.tv</a>


There's nothing here though.

Why?

Introverted. Black. Female. Out of shape. The list goes on.

It is not so much that I can't take insults; this has been a thing that has been part of my life ever since I stepped foot into day care. The issue for me is *my mouth*. I don't suffer fools and I will let them know as much. This is why I haven't.

But this is changing.

I am in a new place that is pretty rad. I have new equipment. And I don't look as bad as I did when I streamed to Livecoding.tv.

## Things I am working on

I am currently brainstorming [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) lessons in Evernote. I am not sure what to teach but [Joel Hooks](https://twitter.com/jhooks) of Egghead has pointed out that I have *a lot* of material on my blog and to whittle it down to the best content and teach it. So this is what I'll do this weekend.

I am also thinking of doing some YouTube[^1] and hopefully doing more webinars.

## So what is my setup?

You can find some of this on [Kit](https://kit.com/tiffanywhitedev) but just to give you a preview:

## What does it look like all setup?

Glad you asked.
