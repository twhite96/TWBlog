So I finished the first front-end project for Free Code Camp in a couple days. It doesn’t render really well on mobile. I can’t seem to get the button I have at the bottom to do the following with the jQuery I have:

<pre class="lang:javascript decode:1 " >
$(&lsquo;.center_button&rsquo;).click(function() {
$(&lsquo;.center_button&rsquo;).css({
&lsquo;position&rsquo; : &lsquo;fixed&rsquo;,
&lsquo;bottom&rsquo; : 0,
&lsquo;left&rsquo; : 0,
&lsquo;right&rsquo; : 0
});
$(&lsquo;p&rsquo;).toggle(&ldquo;slow&rdquo;);
});
</pre>

Minimal jQuery to achieve a nice effect. It works on tablets though not quite the way it is intended.

I will probably work on it some more during the coming weeks.
<h3>On To The Next One</h3>

Our next front-end project will be a little bit more difficult and will probably take me a lot more time. Here is what the example like, down below. The scrolling of the images is janky and I am not crazy about the design but I like what he did.
