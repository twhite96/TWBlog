I am building all kinds of things! Learning Loops, Arrays, and Objects now that I finished the JavaScript Basics course in 5 days. I have 6 badges and looking to get more and more, as quickly as possible.

Look out for a podcast soon on Treehouse, tomorrow or later today.

Check out this Pen I made from a Treehouse challenge. Did it for my writer friends. In order not to annoy you with alerts, I chose JavaScript to be the default tab in the Pen. Click the result tab to play:

&nbsp;

[codepen_embed height="268" theme_id="0" slug_hash="oXadEd" default_tab="js" user="twhite96"]
// quiz begins, no answers correct
var correct = 0;

// ask questions

var answer1 = prompt(&amp;quot;This character wound up in 12 of Ernest Hemingway&#039;s short stories.&amp;quot;);
if (answer1.toUpperCase() === &#039;NICK ADAMS&#039;) {
correct += 1;
}
var answer2 = prompt(&amp;quot;Who wrote Uylsses?&amp;quot;);
if (answer2.toUpperCase() === &#039;JAMES JOYCE&#039;) {
correct += 1;
}
var answer3 = prompt(&amp;quot;This author wrote their best work in a collection of stories called Cathedral.&amp;quot;);
if (answer3.toUpperCase() === &#039;RAY CARVER&#039; || answer3.toUpperCase === &#039;RAYMOND CARVER&#039;) {
correct += 1;
}
var answer4 = prompt(&amp;quot;She wrote In the Cemetery Where Al Jolson is Buried.&amp;quot;);
if (answer4.toUpperCase() === &#039;AMY HEMPEL&#039;) {
correct += 1;
}
var answer5 = prompt(&amp;quot;This writer drowned themselves in the river after filling her pockets with rocks in 1941&amp;quot;);
if (answer5.toUpperCase() === &#039;VIRGINIA WOOLF&#039;) {
correct += 1;
}

// outputs results
alert(&amp;quot;You got &amp;quot; + correct + &amp;quot; out of 5 questions correct.&amp;quot;);

// outputs rank
if (correct === 5) {
alert(&amp;quot;You won a gold Pulitzer wrapped in diamonds!&amp;quot;);
} else if (correct &amp;gt;= 3) {
alert(&amp;quot;You won the MacArthur Fellowship. Not bad.&amp;quot;);
} else if (correct &amp;gt;= 1) {
alert(&amp;quot;You made the Amazon Best Seller list for some niche genre. Not bad. Not good either.&amp;quot;)
} else {
alert(&amp;quot;You are a flash fiction writer with no credits. Sucks to be you!&amp;quot;);
}
