Since starting Check Yo Self a month ago, I have been at a loss as to what the logic should be, how to register click event handlers with jQuery, basically everything I learned the past two years, I drew a blank on [^1].

This baffled me. How could I know so much when talking to others, when learning and watching countless tutorials, but actually draw a blank when it came time to work on the logic?

## Meditation, Deep Work, and the Ability to Focus

I had a lot of ideas. A lot. I wasn’t writing them down [^2]. I was also suffering from the paralysis of choice and impostor syndrome. All of these ideas, everything I know, and the fear I had in building this caused a slump in production, where I focused mainly on the HTML and CSS, which is nothing [^3].

I would sit there, dumbly looking at the `app.js` file like, *what do I do? What do I do?*

I took a bit of a break and thought about it. I started meditating, getting rid of distractions like Facebook [^4], and really started thinking about what was happening.

## Enter The Whiteboard

So as I was writing this article, I was thinking about how I was going to explain my recent thought process. My thought process is a bit scattered; lots of things to think about when shipping a product, and lots of JavaScript-y things to think about to get your app running.

I stood up to get a bite to eat, walk around, when I stood in front of the whiteboard and *all the ideas came flooding back to me*.

I picked up the marker and started thinking of how to register a button click, what event handlers I need after the button click, how to store the text documents, and a few other jQuery-y things.

I ended up with this:

Mighty crooked, though." width="4032" height="3024" /> I finally put it to good use. Mighty crooked, though.[/caption]

There isn’t a whiteboard big enough to fit all my ideas on [^5]. I know about event handlers, jQuery, and most vanilla JavaScript.

But I have some working code and pseudocode to sift through.

I added the whiteboard picture to Evernote and will probably add it to Quiver just to make it more programmer-like.



[^1]: I have notes but not for everything. It probably wouldn’t have mattered anyway.
[^2]: Still guilty of this.
[^3]: I feel I need to quantify this: nothing for someone of my skill-level and experience though CSS is changing rapidly and I am learning as I go.
[^4]: Still on it, though. I am in some really great groups. I also have a Facebook brand page for my other blog. I deleted all the apps and have a block on my mobile and desktop browsers for pretty much all day until evening, when I am most likely to browse it.
