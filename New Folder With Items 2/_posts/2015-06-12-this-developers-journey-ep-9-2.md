This week: What I’ve been doing this week (killing code, that’s what), women and minorities in tech and the fact that maybe there just isn’t any real interest in this in these demographics, and great news for this podcast and blog.

Show Notes:

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianalopez/2015/03/06/making-the-technology-field-more-open-to-women/2/">Making the Technology Field More Open to Women</a>

Code &amp; Supply is an AWESOME resource for Pittsburgh developers.
