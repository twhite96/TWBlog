<h3>First Three Months</h3>

<p>How am I doing on the goals I set for myself? The next five bullet points will address this.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Code everyday</em>. This was very hard to do when I was a student in the traditional sense. But since I left academia to pursue coding on my own time, I code every single day. Not kidding. Between working on Free Code Camp projects or just doing coding exercises, I code ever yday when I have the most energy, which is right after dinner.</li>
<li><em>Get more exercise</em>. This one is a total fail. I was very depressed during my time this semester as a student. To give you an example of this: I only just left my apartment yesterday after not being out of it since February 11th. I went for a walk yesterday. I had been without some crucial medicine which caused me to not get real sleep for four days. The walk yesterday was much needed but I completely fell apart when I got back. My body is not used to not moving around for long periods of time. I plan on getting back to the gym once my body gets acclimated to moving around again, and once I am fully rested and hydrated.</li>
<li><em>Get more sleep</em>. Eh. Kind of. Now that I have nowhere to go during the day, I can sleep in. But I don&#8217;t want to make this a routine practice. I really, ideally, would like to get up at 11:30 am and be in bed by 1:30 am.</li>
<li><em>Put more effort into school</em>. I quit. Nothing more to say there.</li>
<li><em>Read more</em>. This one is an emphatic <strong>win</strong>. I have read 13 books so far, thanks to audiobooks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next Three Months</h3>

<p>I will probably do better in the exercise and sleep department, as I need to. I also want to get to more meetups. I can do that now that I am not pressed for time.</p>

<p>I will be sharing my progress and reassessing what I need to get done in three months. These goals may change.</p>
