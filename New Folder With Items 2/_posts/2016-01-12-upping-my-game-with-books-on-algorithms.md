<h3>Books I Am Reading Now on Algorithms, etc.</h3>
So I was doing some editing on my Book Collectorz database and came across an ebook I didn’t even remember buying: Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript. I went searching for it at Amazon to get the physical copy but the reviews were pretty negative as there were plenty of errata in the book and code samples. <a id="fnref:1" class="footnote" title:="see footnote" href="1">[1]</a>

You can find the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-JavaScript-Michael-McMillan/dp/1449364934">here</a>. You have an option to download Mozilla’s SpiderMonkey JavaScript shell and work on js natively on your machine, which is nice.

The reason I decided to read this book, right now, is that I am struggling with the Free Code Camp Bonfires and need a kind of boost.

I am also reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452650581&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=clean+code">Clean Code</a> which is a great introduction to naming conventions and best practices in programming in Java. <a id="fnref:2" class="footnote" title:="see footnote" href="2">[2]</a>
<h3>Fast-moving Reintroduction to Java</h3>
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://helloburgh.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Fast.jpeg" alt="fast_paced" />

So we are going over Java basics in class. I need to read chapter 2, but I am pretty sure I know about variables and all that jazz. Just seems we are going breakneck into the parts of programming everyone in that class knows and I am just scared that I may miss something. <a id="fnref:3" class="footnote" title:="see footnote" href="3">[3]</a>

I will probably read chapter 2 again tonight. This is just intro stuff rehashed. Don’t know why I am so scared about the pace. If he was going over JFrame and GUIs this fast I’d probably fall out of my chair…
