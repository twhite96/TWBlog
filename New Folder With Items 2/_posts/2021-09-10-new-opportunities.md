So I've found employment for the first time since March 2020.

It is a contract with a pretty cool startup. I've been working there for two weeks now. 

The contract is for 6 months with an option to hire if more funding comes round.

In the meantime check the tweets below. I couldn't have asked for a better team and place to work, learn, and grow.

Truly happy!
