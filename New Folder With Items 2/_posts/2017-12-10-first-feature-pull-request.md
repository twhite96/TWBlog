I spent a good week working on our [CodePen Liquid Tag feature](https://dev.to/twhite/changelog-codepen-liquid-tags-now-live-amj). It was my first time working with a team on a feature for an app that wasn’t solely mine.

I was nervous. But it was *really fun*.

Mac, our Senior dev instructed me. He remarked that it didn’t take me long to pick it up and off I went, getting the feature built with time to spare[^1].

Shortly after, I created my first PR. I can’t tell you how long I’ve waited to make a PR on a project I believed in. I got that chance and it went well.

## Feature and PR
I find that, since I spent a lot of time learning JavaScript, Mongo, Mongoose, Node and the like, that digging into Ruby, Rails, ActiveRecord, and things like this aren’t too difficult.

One of the things that helped me was when [Mac](https://dev.to/maestromac) and [Ben](https://dev.to/ben) told me to look at another file. I was able to discern what to do, and cobbled together a basic framework of the feature. I then built upon that and continued to ask Mac questions which he patiently answered.

I submitted the PR and it was merged shortly after.

I submitted a PR to another project but it wasn’t merged. I wasn’t ready then. But now, I have had two PRs merged and am working on a third feature.

## Work Is Fun
The team is great. The perks are great, even for an intern like me. And I absolutely believe in what we’re trying to build.
