So I essentially said, “School is not for me. Plus, I don’t have the money to finish anyway. Time to hang up the Pitt hoodie”.

So that’s what I did. No mental health issues this time, just a real sense that I could be learning and doing so much more than what I was on my own.

And that happens to be the case. No surprise to me as at this time last year I was doing the same and actually working and enjoying myself.

I have a strict schedule of learning I stick to daily:

This way I am constantly learning and sharpening my skills. There is also a free bootcamp here in Pittsburgh called [Academy Pittsburgh](http://www.academypgh.com/) that looks really interesting, if not out of my way. I may check it out.

I have to code often, learn faster, and get better in a hurry. I want to work, and this is the way to showcase I can do it.

## First **Real** Pull Request

One of the things I want to start doing more of is contributing to open source projects. I went looking for *first-timers only* sites on doing OSS for the newbie.

I have opened pull requests before for class but never for an organization. One site I went to was [First Timers Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/). It was a great help but I needed more. So I went down the page and found a [GitHub link](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Afirst-timers-only&state=open&type=Issues) to repos that had issues tagged `first-timers-only`. I came upon a project by Teammates which is basically for students and are very welcoming of newcomers. They work with Java, JavaScript and others[^1].

Made a few edits to an issue that had been lingering for 14 days. I made a few stylistic mistakes. Setting up the dev environment was cumbersome for such a small edit. Learning IntelliJ on the fly has been a rewarding experience. I went through 15 commits and edits before and after I made the pull request. It needs code review and someone to look it over as it seems I made too many edits but other than that, I am waiting to see what becomes of it. Basically I removed an unused class file and added the contents of that class file to another class file as a private enum. Pretty simple stuff.

If it doesn’t get merged, I’m okay with that. At least I *did it*. Soon enough, my pull requests will get accepted more and more.

## Working on My Own OS Project

I am trying to think about what libraries in Java and JavaScript I could make. I know [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/learn/v4) helps you to build your own JavaScript library. Looking forward to this so that I can modify it and open source it.

I am also looking forward to understanding *how* to build a library in any language so that I can actually contribute to the open source community instead of taking.

## Free Code Camp Weather App Update

Back working on it. Not much else to report about it though. Still struggling a bit.

[^1]: I did my first pull request in Java. It was very easy.
