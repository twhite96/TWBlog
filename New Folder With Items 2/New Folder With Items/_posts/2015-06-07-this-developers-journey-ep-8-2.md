Show Notes:

No external links today. I thought about talking about functional programming and I did, but cut it– I only had a shallow understanding of it and didn’t prepare to talk about it by writing or outlining the points I wanted to make– a fatal flaw for a good recording. I’ll talk about it later, after I’ve prepped better.

I want to get John Sonmez and the show. You can find out more about him <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/">here</a> and find the book I’m reading by John called Soft Skills: The software developer’s life manual <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617292397/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1617292397&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=makithecompsi-20&amp;linkId=YNX4566EEVSNF3IL">here</a>
