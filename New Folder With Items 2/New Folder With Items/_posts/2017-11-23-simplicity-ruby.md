When I first started this blog, I was learning Ruby and I loved it.

This was before starting freeCodeCamp or Zed Shaw’s Learn Python the Hard Way series [^1].

When I decided I wanted to program for a living, I found some meetups and went to my first one in 2014, [Code &amp; Supply](https://codeandsupply.co/) where Ruby was the topic; getting it set up on our systems and writing a pretty simple Ruby program.

Ruby was so simple. Take this, for example:

```ruby
class MyClass
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end
```
If you know anything at all about OOP, you know what is happening here.

Where the beauty of Ruby lies is in its eerily easy to read syntax.

```ruby
class MyClass
```
creates a class where we’ll hold all our objects and methods.

`def`: define. Here we are defining a method `initialize` with two local variables
`name` and `age`. We assign them to the instance variables `@name` and `@age` in order to use them *outside* of the object’s scope. We end the method and class with the `end` keyword.

Outside of the OOP instance variable syntax, this is super easy to read and understand.

## First Day Feels
It is 10pm and I really need to get to bed soon. But I just wanted a chance to write about how patient the team at The Practical Dev has been with me as I learn the ropes.

On-boarding was a breeze and I have already started digging into the codebase.

My first day was fraught with nerves and expectations that I had for myself [^2].
Remembering that I am not the sole developer on a project and I have a team to refer to is taking some getting used to. The team is great and I definitely ask questions: have never been shy about that. I am just so damn shy and quiet. This is something I am working on.

They even purchased a lower lumbar cushion and keyboard for me, which I can purchase when I move on.

It has been a great first week so far and I am looking forward to the weeks to come.

[^1]: LPTHW is quite opinionated and I am not sure if it is still recommended to new developers.
