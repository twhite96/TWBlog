Learning the hard way that CSS, is in fact, a necessary skill.

Most of experience with CSS was through libraries like Bootstrap, Reactstrap, Bulma, and Tailwind.css.

In this recent project, I had to Flexbox and Flexbox *quickly*. I have a Wes Bos grid and flexbox course sitting in the course library I have of his. I never watched either, thinking I was mainly going to *JavaScript the f out of things* with little consideration to the styling.

I like beautiful things but CSS intimidates me, as it does *a lot* of JavaScript devs. You know the gif I'm talking about. I just recently shared this gif on a site complaining about how hard CSS *is*.

I have a metric heckton of respect for CSS mavens and masters. Because I suck at it. Give me the logic in a project and I'll get it done. Tell me to skew a div and I am like *what are a skew*? *What means degrees*? I am terrible at complex layouts like this.

## CS web dev classes

I took an intro web dev class about 4 years ago and learned *a lot* about CSS, the box model, specificity, the cascade. You know what's tragic though? Not practicing it and instead reaching for a UI library that would make my projects pretty.

It's unfortunate, not just for me, but for *all* devs and engineers that a lot of us lack the ability to see CSS as a valuable tool for developing web apps, not a UI library, but *actual CSS*. Learning it is valuable, even if you want to play logician with heavy handed JavaScript.

## Project near done

This freelance project is nearly finished, well, at least my part of it. I learned that I still have a ton to learn about CSS. The project is on a hella tight deadline and it would be one thing if it wasn't but it *is* and so I'm probably getting moved off it.

I don't feel that bad about it though because I know where I need to improve. It was also really hectic moving as fast as we did. I feel bad for the senior front end engineer on that team because she's got to put out fires that I couldn't imagine putting out. Not now, anyway.

## Experience

I've gained valuable insight into what my strengths and weaknesses are. If the project moves on without me I am taking a week to just relax and apply to jobs. While I'm at it, I am going to consume Wes Bos' CSS courses because well. I'm bad it and it won't ever go out of style.
