  I was doing a little GitHub dumpster
  diving, scrolling through who I was
  following. Found a guy who I really
  wanted to keep an eye on who hadn’t
  posted in a while. I went through his
  repos and found a personal goals repo.
  It was a fork. I went directly to the
  source and found it was Una Kravets
  repo.

[Una Kravets](https://twitter.com/una) is one of my favorite designers/developers even though I just discovered who she was, and by accident.

I was doing a little GitHub dumpster diving, scrolling through who I was following. Found a guy who I wanted to keep an eye on who hadn’t posted in a while. I went through his repos and found a personal goals repo. It was a fork. I went to the source and found it was <a href="https://github.com/una/personal-goals">Una Kravets repo</a>.

## Open Sourcing Your Goals Makes You More Productive

Accountability is a thing that most humans need [^1]. Open sourcing my goals has made me pay attention to what I am doing and when. This past week I didn’t get much done, and hesitated sharing it to my [personal goals repo](https://github.com/twhite96/personal-goals). But I did. And it looks pretty bad.

## Goals for the Year and Year in Review Posts

Una posts her *Goals for the Year* and *Year in Review* on her blog and I decided I’d do the same thing on this one.

I had my goals on [my other blog](https://thatmacnerd.com/blog/). Since it is no longer a Apple productivity blog I’ll do it here. It makes more sense here than there.

## What Do You Think

I thought this was a great idea immediately. What do *you* think? Will you try it? Two weeks in and I am hooked.
