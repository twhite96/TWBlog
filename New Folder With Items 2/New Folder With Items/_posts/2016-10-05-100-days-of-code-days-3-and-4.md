## Day 4: 4 October 2016

<img class="size-full wp-image-1345 aligncenter" src="https://helloburgh.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/code-optimization-xxl.png" alt="" width="256" height="256" />

**Today’s Progress:** I went to InfoSci class today. When I got home, I ate, and went to work on the e-commerce site.

I migrated *The Lens Cap* over to a GitHub Project Page as Heroku became to fiddly. I had a bug in my mobile toggle nav and the CSS wasn't linked right. It seems I am not good with absolute and relative links.

I finally figured it out with some trial and error.

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty proud of what I have so far. I need to build out the linked pages to reflect what I want them to do. I have *Cart, Lenses,* and *Pricing*. I also need to figure out where to link the *View Details* links under the lens grids.

**Link to work:** You can find it at [The Lens Cap](https://twhite96.github.io/The-Lens-Cap/).

## Day 3: 3 October 2016

**Yesterday's Progress:** I worked pretty hard on the navbar bug. I couldn't figure out why my CSS wasn't rendering in Heroku.

**Thoughts:** I've been going at it pretty hard lately. I have a hard deadline for the first part of this CS project and I'm hustling.

**Link to work:** Linked above.
