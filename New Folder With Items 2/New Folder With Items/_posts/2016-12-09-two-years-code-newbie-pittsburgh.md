I have been writing here at Code Newbie in Pittsburgh for almost two years. It will be two years on December 26th.

I got the idea for the blog at my mom's house over Christmas break. I got a few iTunes Gift Cards, bought Byword and the Byword Premium upgrade to publish to WordPress and I drafted my first post on the free WordPress.com host.

I have written here every month since January of 2015. Last month there was only one post as I haven't done a serious amount of coding lately and anything technical or extremely technical I write over at my [GitHub Page Blog](https://twhite96.github.io).

You really need to write a lot of blog posts to get into the habit and any time off will spell atrophy and I am currently experiencing this.

This semester was easy and while I had a lot of coding to do, it wasn't like in previous semesters and it wasn't as difficult.

The winter break is just that-- a break. I plan on doing some OSS work and coding so that I have at least *something* to write about. I will probably pick up Free Code Camp again. Lots to write about when I do that. :-)

## Semester is Over. How Did I Do?
### InfoSci Class

Still waiting to take my InfoSci final. I was sick during our exam with a very ferocious sinus migraine so I am making it up today.

InfoSci was an interesting class. While I am probably going to end up with a C in this class, it isn't because it was anymore difficult than my Computer Science class and more because I just didn't schedule my classes right. Can't take a night class and then have to get up earlier the next day and go to a class.

I screwed myself over a couple times, one, on the mid-term, where I felt I had studied enough Binary Numbers to get an A or B on the midterm. I hadn't the grip on Binary numbers that I thought and my luck was such that the test's weight was in binary numbers. I ended up with a C.

I failed our Logic gate homework because I didn't associate AND, NOT, OR, XOR, and NAND gates with the logistical operators in programming. Had I made that connection, I would have aced it. I didn't put two and two together until the following class, and by then it was too late.

### CS Class

I aced this class. I seriously did. The lowest grade I got was on a quiz and that was a C. I got an A on everything else. This was an intro web dev class. I am taking the intermediate web dev class this coming semester as well as and intermediate programming with Java class.

## What Will the Next Two Years Hold?

## What Will the Next Two Years Hold?





I will hopefully be graduated by the time two more years is up. I will probably be actively seeking employment in the 'burgh and then, after experience is gained, moving out west. I wonder what I will call this blog then? ;-)
