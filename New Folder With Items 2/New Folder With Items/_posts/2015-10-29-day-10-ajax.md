So a few days ago, I started the AJAX track at Treehouse. So with AJAX, all sorts of cool things happen, like a Google Maps, Gmail, etc, where you can load new content without reloading the page. So when you open up a map in Google Maps and scroll to another part of the map and it stays on the same page but in a different spot, you know what that is? That’s AJAX. BOOM.

So currently learning about things like XMLHttpRequest or xhr, .readystate, .onreadystatechange, and other event listeners, as well GET, POST, and JSON and error codes like 404 or 401, and the success code of 200.
