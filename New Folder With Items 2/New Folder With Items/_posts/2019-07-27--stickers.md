Just recently I bought [this case](https://www.amazon.com/i-Blason-MacBook-Soft-Touch-Frosted-Display/dp/B01M4P3E1N/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=macbook+pro+15+touch+bar+case+clear&qid=1562806606&refinements=p_72%3A2661618011&rnid=2661617011&s=gateway&sr=8-4) from Amazon to cover up my company issued MacBook Pro so I could...

*cover it with stickers*...

as devs do.

So here is my stickered up MacBook Pro. What's your laptop cover looking like? You can [hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tiffanywhitedev) with your setup.
