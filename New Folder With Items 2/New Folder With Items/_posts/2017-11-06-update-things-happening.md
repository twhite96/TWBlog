I thought I’d post a short update about why I haven’t been blogging as much.

It was during a #DevDiscuss Twitter chat. Initially, Pablo Rivera tweeted to [Stephanie Hurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt) about getting me a job. She tweeted back to tweet to her my portfolio, resume, etc and that I am looking for work. She would then retweet it to her large following of potential employers and companies.

I did:

That’s all I can really say but I have honestly just been trying to process what is happening and how, when it comes together and tries, the tech community is the best there is…
