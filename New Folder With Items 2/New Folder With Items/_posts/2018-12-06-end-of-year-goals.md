Let's start this post off with a bit of honesty:

*This year has been hell, emotionally, mentally, physically, and professionally*.

I will be glad to see this year flame out in glorious fashion. I won't miss it. But this post isn't going to be a pessimistic one and instead pragmatic, looking back at the triumphs and professional letdowns of this year.

At the end, I will be laying out my professional goals for 2019. You down? Good. Let's talk.

## 2018 Goals Rewind

* 2018 Goal 1: Get hired as a junior developer
	* Progress: did not happen.
* 2018 Goal 2: Move to a nicer home
	* Progress: *happened. The best part of the year. I love this place*.
* 2018 Goal 3: Stop worrying about vanity metrics for the blog
	* Progress: Yes. For the most part.
* 2018 Goal 4: Learn...*a whole bunch of stuff that was unrealistic to learn all of that in the first place*
	* Progress: Learned React and some GraphQL, which isn't even on this list. Played around with Gatsby.
* 2018 Goal 5: Gain another 300 followers
	* Progress: done.
* 2018 Goal 6: Create some interesting and useful libraries and open source them
	* Progress: Created some but they aren't finished. *Need to get on that*.
* 2018 Goal 7: Dive more into CSS and WebAnimations API
	* Progress: Nope.

Basically this year was a failure: the main thing I wanted was to get hired and I failed at that. I feel like this year the tides will turn though.

## 2019 Goals

> These are SMART goals in Notion but I skipped the **do by** in this section for brevity

* Get gainful employment
* Interview with two companies a month
* Use Twitter to network with more companies
	* Twitter has been more effective than LinkedIn. If you're a developer, get a decent following on Twitter. You'll thank me later.
* Learn more about Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript with courses by Colt Steele and Kyle Shevlin
	* Need to finish these by the end of March if I'm being honest
* Reapply to [big company] if not gainfully employed by end of April
* Get better at GraphQL
* Get familiar with Typescript
	* It's unavoidable at this point
* Learn a new concept weekly and write about it on this blog
* Create a new egghead.io lesson monthly
	* Create a full course each quarter[^1]
* Contribute to `devtools.html` weekly
* Contribute to `wp-calypso` weekly
* Contribute to `learn-code-from-us` weekly
* Create a new project every quarter and open source it[^2]
* Make first PR to `reactjs` by the end of April
* Make first PR to `gatsbyjs` by end of June

## Whoa There Pa'tna. That's A LOT OF GOALZZZZ

Yeah I know but I feel like I did f all this past year it was so taxing on me. I need to ramp things up. So that's why *all this*.
