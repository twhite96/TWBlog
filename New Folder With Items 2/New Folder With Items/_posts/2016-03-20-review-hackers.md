<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8646752">Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution - 25th Anniversary Edition</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32131">Steven Levy</a>
My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1576869358">5 of 5 stars</a>

This book was great in the sense it gave me insights into some of my favorite hackers (well, just two-- Woz and Jobs). I am not sure why Steven included Jobs-- he was more of a businessman and showman than an engineer and it showed in his work. He asked Woz to finish a project for him at Atari. Not the hacker type but if you're going to dedicate a couple hours of the book on Apple Computer, it makes sense to include him.

It also inspired me, as a new, self-taught engineer, to rethink math. I was really good at it but things delayed my learning, as well as being an arrogant teenager full of herself. I have since looked at BÃ©zier functions and have downloaded a few KU calc books.

If you'd like insights on geeky geniuses who have literally shaped the world today, give it a listen/read. Not all of them are likeable (Richard Stallman) but their quirks are endearing, if you're the geeky, introverted type.

5 stars because I am into that sort of thing and Levy does a good job of cleaning up his earlier mistakes. I wish he would have maybe cut some of the main part of the book to include more about today's hackers but still, a great read.
