If you aren’t reading my fellow Code Newbie <a href="http://nickqueen.com/blog/">Nick Queen’s blog</a> you should. It’s great. Besides being great, the format has given me an idea.

So I am thinking of stepping up my blogging game. I blog enough, sure, but as you can see, Nick posts everyday because he smashes a new goal on Treehouse <strong>everyday</strong>. He is so driven, like Mark, my other Code Newbie alum, that it has inspired me, along with his blog, to tackle something everyday and blog about what I’ve learned. I need to figure out how to post the badge at the top of the post but I can google that or ask Nick.

So later tonight I have to block off time on my schedule to blog everyday for daily updates or every other day that I smash a new goal.

Also, if you’re hiring take a look at Nick’s <a href="http://nickqueen.com/">site</a>. He has his resume listed there.

So, even though I am learning quite quickly, it is synthesizing this new learning to tackle projects. I keep notes in Quiver and snippets of code in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snippetslab/id1006087419?mt=12">SnippetsLab</a> but it’s putting it all together.

I started this blog post last night and during the period where I am about to go to sleep but not yet I thought about my address book app and how to use objects and empty arrays with the .push(), .shift(), .pop(), and .unshift() as well as key/value pairs and HTML forms. It wasn’t a coherent synthesis but I was piecing together how this JavaScript was going to take shape. It felt good to know I was getting some synthesis but there is much more learning to be done. Currently learning Java to be prepared for the semester.

So this is the plan. Starting tonight!
