<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28419314">Keynote, Professional Presentations and Animations</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14823298">Angelo Spiler</a>
My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1579146369">4 of 5 stars</a>

I was asked by the author to review this book.

This book is a great primer on Keynote, Apple's answer to PowerPoint.

I have very basic experience with Keynote but am savvy enough to figure it out without much help.

There were definitely some nuggets to wisdom in this book about features I hadn't realized existed in Keynote, such as formulas in tables, animating photos with Actions, and actually doing graphics/vector work in Keynote.

I wouldn't suggest doing complicated graphics work in Keynoteâ€” it is not a design tool. The author made some pretty complicated vectors with Keynote that I could do in Affinity Designer of Sketch more intuitively. But if you don't have experience with design software, try to look up the exact photos or vectors you need online, which will save a lot of time.

For beginners and and Intermediate Keynote users this is a great book. I'm certain advanced users have this stuff down.

4 stars for the quality of the information and the exercise files. One star off for text formatting issues.
