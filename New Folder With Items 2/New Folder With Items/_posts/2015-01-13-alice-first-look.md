<h1>Alice First Look</h1>

<p>So, I started reading my Programming with Alice textbook and I am really getting into it. The picture up top is a screenshot of the Mac interface. It is the older version and it looks it.</p>

<p>Tonight, going through the textbook, I learned a little bit about <strong>sequential processing</strong>, <strong>conditionals</strong>, and <strong>reductionism</strong>or <strong>problem decompostion</strong>. It was a few hours ago and I don&#8217;t quite remember what each was, word for word but it is sort of like sequential processing and problem reductionism have similar ways of thinking. First I do this, then this, then I&#8217;ll do this in order to complete this complex task. The example given was of cleaning your house: you take the living room first, then the bathroom, bedrooms, etc in order to complete cleaning the whole, breaking the complex task down into managable parts.</p>

<p>Got to the part of the text where we&#8217;d need to be sitting in front of the computer and I looked at the interface some more. I picked the space template but there are tons more our prof is going to give us in class tomorrow, I am assuming.</p>

<p>The text offered some insights on 2D and 3D modeling and what and where things were/are. I then started playing around with the interface, ignoring the text altogether:</p>

<p>I added a female scientist and a male scientist but of course, the female will be my lead. I also added a ship and a probe.</p>

<p>Here is the quad view:</p>

<p>The program is rich with things I can do. I click on an object and can resize it, move different parts of the ship, or the bodies, I can rotate them, tell them what to say and do, adjust the camera angle. What I am a little concerned about is the natural language part of learning the commands&#8211; no technical programmers speak and you can&#8217;t really write a bug. I guess since this is just to whet the appetite of would-be programmers it&#8217;s okay.</p>

<p>Once I get more into it I&#8217;ll do some screencasts of the program coming together.</p>
