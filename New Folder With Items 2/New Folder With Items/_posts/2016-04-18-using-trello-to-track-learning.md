<p>Chris Johnson, one of my favorite programming <a href="http://www.thatamazingprogrammer.com/blog/">bloggers</a> posted his Trello <a href="https://trello.com/b/iMkh9HVu/asp-net-mvc-mastery">board</a> for ASP.NET MVC Mastery. I saved the board as it is public but I forgot I had it. I just recently looked at it and <strong>whoa</strong>. A great idea, indeed.</p>

<p>So I copied the board minus the cards and started work on my own board. It is called Full-Stack JavaScript Mastery. I copied all the lists and edited them to work more along the lines of what I need to do.</p>

<h2>Descriptions of Lists</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Information

		<ul>
			<li>This has the cards:

				<ul>
					<li>Purpose- The purpose of the board</li>
					<li>Who Am I- A brief introduction to who I am and what I need to do with the board</li>
					<li>Where Am I- Lists all my social and blog links</li>
				</ul></li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Resources

		<ul>
			<li>The cards here are

				<ul>
					<li>Free Code Camp and its link</li>
					<li>Treehouse Front-end Development track and its link</li>
					<li>Treehouse Full-stack JavaScript and its link</li>
					<li>JavaScript Understanding the Weird Parts and its link</li>
				</ul></li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Skills Needed

		<ul>
			<li>Lists all the skills I need to be a full-stack JavaScript developer with some extraneous skills and helper skills mixed in.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>The Road Map

		<ul>
			<li>Has one card that will be updated when I figure out the plan to get one set of skills done at a time.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li> Free Code Camp Full-stack Mastery

		<ul>
			<li>Here I will list the skills I have learned during my time at Free Code Camp which is my current place of constant learning</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Treehouse Front-end Development

		<ul>
			<li>Same as with Free Code Camp’s card</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Treehouse Full-stack JavaScript Track</li>
	<li>Pluralsight JavaScript Courses</li>
	<li>JavaScript Understanding the Weird Parts</li>
</ul>
