Seems that a lot of developers are creating these `/uses` pages after discovering [Wes Bos’s](https://twitter.com/wesbos) [/uses page](http://wesbos.com/uses).

My favorite of these happens to be from [Jon Suh](https://twitter.com/jonsuh). His [/uses page](https://jonsuh.com/uses/) includes a photo, which is what I did here.

While I was interning, I had enough money to make my desk setup look *sick* as Wes and Scott would say. So some of the stuff below will change.

## Gear

Let’s start with my gear.

	- I just bought this earlier this year and Apple updates it five months later. Oh well.

## Software

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
	- It does everything I need it to do. Atom was nice and had a lot of features but goddamn it’s hella slow. So I went back to VS Code [^2] and couldn’t be happier.
- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
	- I will never use a terminal without this installed.
- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) for UI design
- [Boom 3D](http://www.globaldelight.com/boom3d/index.php)
	- This makes everything sound *amazing*.
- Xcode
- Chrome
- PopClip
	- Using PopClip is a lifesaver. When it doesn’t work I am lost.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
	- Workflows make this my favorite app. I can’t live without it. You can find my workflows [here](https://cl.ly/1W2N1P1z213i/Alfred_workflows.jpg). I have way too many, I admit.
- Text Expander
- [Lightroom CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html)
	- For basic edits. Yeah, I bit on the Adobe train but only the photography bundle with 1TB of storage.
- [Lightroom Classic CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html)
  - For all my editing needs. It is what I started using years ago. Muscle memory, and all that.
- Amphetamine to keep my Mac awake
- [Shell Runner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shell-runner/id689441182?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS)
	- To test shell scripts
- [BetterSnapTool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS) is my choice for window snapping.
- [Quiver](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quiver-the-programmers-notebook/id866773894?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS) is a programmers notebook to take notes with syntax highlighting and markdown support. Supports many languages [^3].
- [Tweetbot 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-2-for-twitter/id557168941?mt=12)
  - The 3rd iteration hogs CPU and memory. If it was more efficient I'd use it; the ability to add gifs right in the app is killer. But it freezes constantly. So I use v2.
- [Franz](https://meetfranz.com/). This is a chat aggregator. Open source and wayyyyyy better looking than Rambox.
- [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for tasks.[^4]
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so) for Project management.[^5]
- [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
  - Nothing beats it for note-taking and archiving.
- [Fantastical 2](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) for scheduling
- [Dash 4](https://kapeli.com/dash). [^6]
- [Sip for Mac](https://sipapp.io/) for a color picker
- [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm)
  - As I get into making egghead lessons and more screencasts for That Mac Nerd, I need a heavy duty piece of software to do so. Screenflow fits the bill.
- [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/welcome)
  - Going to stream at Twitch soon enough. This is the gold standard but their Mac app is terribly behind the Windows app.
- [Private Internet Access VPN](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/)
  - Should always have a VPN.
- [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/)
  - This is how I share bugs and other things with devs and dev teams. Also an easy way to make a gif of a feature or bug on my Mac.
- [Setapp](https://setapp.com/)
  - It finally has enough utilities to make it worth the subscription price for me.

## I Use a lot of software, I admit

But I use ALL OF IT.

So this is my setup and what I am currently using. You can show me your dev setup on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tiffanywhitedev).


[^1]: Got the gold and this will be my last iPhone for a while. No need to upgrade yearly as these phones are more than capable of lasting a couple years.
[^2]: I did have Ulysses installed. They even featured me on [their blog](https://ulyssesapp.com/blog/2018/04/tiffany-r-white/). I mainly used it to post to WordPress and since I am on Gatsby and Jekyll for everything now I don't need the subscription. I feel really bad. But now I use VSCode for this and a couple scripts to post here and my other blogs.
[^3]: Even brainfuck!
[^4]: This is the only task manager that I actually look at and use. It is *that* beautiful, simple, and it has impressed me far more than any task manager in recent memory.
[^5]: This is such a deep app and I am in love with it. After avoiding it because I was a heavy user of Evernote and quite liked it, there were things that annoyed me about it. Everyone talked about this app, Notion and I signed up. Been using it for two weeks and I have paid the subscription. It's that good. Still setting it up but here's my [dashboard](https://cl.ly/e8ed18d3f574/Screenshot-2018-09-05_12-00-33_AM.png).
[^6]: Offline docs ftw! Plus much more.
