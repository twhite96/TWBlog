## Day 8: 8 October 2016

**Today’s Progress:** I know I haven’t written about the challenge of late but I have been working tirelessly on this e-commerce site.

Today, though, I had an assignment for CS 0134 that is due on Monday so I spent a little bit working on it.

On the 6th and 7th, I added [slick.js](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) jQuery carousel to the e-commerce site. It usually is a simple endeavor, but I had issues with it. I didn’t know where to add the css and js. When I figured that out it still wasn’t working. That was because the files I needed were two directories deep and I was only linking to one directory in.

I fixed that and had to adjust the size of the images in the slider.

I had the slider below the navigation. I went over some of the class material and read that Matt said to keep everything “above the fold” [footnote]that means users shouldn’t have to scroll to get what they need[/footnote]. So, I moved the slider to the middle of the page. At the top of the page the slider wasn’t centered properly; there were gaps between images. Once I moved it…looks a whole lot better.

Today I just added a cart font-awesome icon to the navbar and worked primarily on assignment 2.

**Thoughts:** Things are getting together quite nicely. I am starting to get wound up about it though and so I need to take more of a break. I am Type-A all the way. Once I am heads down and working for a whole week, I find it hard to quit and relax. I need to relax tomorrow so I don’t burn out.

**Link to work:** I didn’t host the assignment anywhere to actually *see* it. **Update**: I posted the code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/twhite96/pen/XjEgvq). As always, you can find my site at [The Lens Cap](https://thelenscap.netlify.com/).
