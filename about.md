Hi. I'm Tiffany. I am a front-end dev at ICF working remotely[^1] in my comfy little apartment in Swatara Twp, PA. I have been programming as an autodidact and university student for three years. I attended the University of Pittsburgh for two years after a stint in a few junior colleges.

My toolbox contains JavaScript, React, some Rails, and Styled Components 💅.

Besides programming and writing for this blog, I enjoy photography, lifting weights when I can, playing around with Go and Swift, automating my apartment with smart home tech, and tinkering with robots 🤖.

[^1]: I'm extremely luck but it *is* [the future of work](https://basecamp.com/books/remote).
