I'm Tiffany. I'm a software engineer at [Calaxy](https://www.calaxy.com) where I work remotely in my comfy little home office in Pennsylvania.

My toolbox contains JavaScript, React & Vue, with some experiments in Blitz.js, Remix Run, and other Rails-like frameworks.

Besides programming and writing for this blog, I enjoy running a home server lab and doing DIY smart home stuff ðŸ¤–.
