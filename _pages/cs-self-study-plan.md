As you're probably aware, the whole CS self-study movement got a huge boost when a guy named [John Washam](https://twitter.com/startupnextdoor), or, as his blog was called, *googleyasheck* set out on an 8 month, rigorous CS self-study plan in order to become a software engineer[^1] at Google.

It didn't go quite as planned, however he did [getting picked up by Amazon](https://startupnextdoor.com/ive-been-acquired-by-amazon/).

I admired his dedication and tenacity and have followed his story quite a bit. Since I decided I wanted to do more software engineering stuff than web development stuff, I decided to take a look at ways I could learn. One stop was [John's very famous GitHub repo](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university). I also found [another one that is more in-depth](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science) than his, believe it for not.

I plan on learning at all the resources: Free Code Camp, Treehouse, Coursera, Udemy, etc plus this. I have made a comprehensive plan to do so in Fantastical 2 on my Mac:

John also shared a screenshot of a Google Sheet he used to track his studying. I asked him for a template and he graciously shared it.

I am including my sheets here so that you can follow along with me. I will be writing more frequent, perhaps shorter, blog posts as I go through each resource bit by bit.

Stay tuned!
