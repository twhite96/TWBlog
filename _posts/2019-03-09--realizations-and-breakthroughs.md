I have been working on Check Yo Self [for](https://checkyoself-docs.netlify.com/blog/2018/07/22/v1-almost-complete.html) [quite](https://checkyoself-docs.netlify.com/blog/2018/09/04/fixing-components.html) [a](https://checkyoself-docs.netlify.com/blog/2018/09/21/v1-weekend-push.html) [while](https://checkyoself-docs.netlify.com/blog/2019/01/25/rewriting-with-md-draftjs.html).

At first, it was because I was deciding on the tech to use. It was full stack. Then it went to using localStorage and basically static. Then I chose React, different editors, making it an MVP, and now to where I am today.

Let's back up a bit, however, to sometime last year.

## Choosing React before even learning it properly

React was the new hotness in 2017 when I was starting this app. I was still a pretty green web developer and chased a lot of technology, though I am sticking with React for now.

I chose a simple React CSS framework to get some sort of semblance of styling up and running, and then I tried to build it.

*I got stuck. Immediately.*

At the end of 2017 I was floundering with this app; at the time I was also interning at [DEV](https://dev.to) and had very little time to work on it. But in 2018, after my internship was over, I went on to buy Wes Bos's [React For Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) course and dove in.

## Getting up to speed but still struggling

I got the basics down right away. But, as I said in a recent [DEV comment](https://dev.to/twhite/comment/9ac9), the tutorial loop is something I stayed stuck in, a complete crutch for my fear of failing. I built components in Check Yo Self basically by looking at Wes's code that I was writing and then using snippets to quickly get up and running. There's nothing wrong with this **unless you're a junior developer**. I was doing some serious copy pasta with the editor and other parts of the app, which is hard to admit.

## Changes

The end of last year saw me forgetting the tutorials and *building things*. I am working on a [command utility](https://checkyoself-cli.netlify.com/docs/doc1.html) based on Check Yo Self, and [other](https://writegoodcomp-docs.netlify.com/docs/doc1.html)
[interesting things](https://github.com/twhite96/gatsby-starter-blog-new-post).

I'm also building dumb React components from scratch to get the hang of how to build them and how they work.

## New mindset

Building the search function for this blog as well as doing some other work in React, *especially* with this blog, has me *thinking* in React and JavaScript in general. Reading the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) is a pleasure and something I started to do last year.

I've learned how to learn and search for my problems and error messages.

I've gone to Twitter and asked around. And when I don't get any response, it's back to the docs.

## Figured out the source of my problem
