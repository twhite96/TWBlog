I started out the year in bad shape. By February it was *on*: coding almost daily, diving into projects, making good on doctor's appointments[^1].

I was reading book after book, learning something new, diving into Slack and Telegram channels. But then.

*Crash*.

The way I structured my goals for this year were *horribly misguided*. There is only so much your body can do, only so much your brain can work on before you *burn out* and that I did.

## Quantitative assessment

Let's start out with reviewing what I wanted to do[^2].

[![Tiffany R. White Blog Goals](/assets/images/posts/2019/goals-click.png)](https://tiffanywhite.dev/end-of-year-goals/)

---

1. I didn't get gainful employment
2. I didn't interview with two companies a month
3. I have increased my Twitter network quite a bit since making these goals
4. Still working on the Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript course by Colt Steele
5. Will apply to big company soon enough
6. Got better at GraphQL[^3]
7. I am starting a Typescript course[^4]
8. I have learned some concepts and have written about them, just not as often as I would have liked.
9. Finished the egghead promo and can now make lessons but I don't know what they will be yet. So no, I haven't made any lessons
10. No I haven't done much open source contributing
11. I have a couple open source projects in the works

## Too much, too soon

I still have *a lot* of time to get some of this done; these were yearly goals. But as far as Q1 goes it has been a moderate success.

[^4]: Seriously outdated but I haven't found one that I like that introduces the basics thoroughly besides this one.
