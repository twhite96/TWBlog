Real artists ship so that's what I vow to do from here on in.

This is monumental for me; I actually shipped something I said I was going to ship, and in less than a month. The thing I shipped is my [new portfolio](https://www.tiffanyrwhite.com/), built with Gatsby and based on the work of Jacob Martinez and heavily inspired by Brittany Chiang's portfolio [which I gush over in this post](/2020/07/08/portfolio-redesign-part-1-ideas/#portfolio-inspo).

It took me two weeks working on it every couple days for a couple hours a day. I took the *gatsby-simple-portfolio* theme, a simple starter, and made it my own.

## The easy part

I wanted the color theme to look like Brittany's because, well, I *really like it*. I used a tool for Mac called [Sip](https://sipapp.io/) to grab the colors from her site and went to work.

## The hard parts

There were several hard parts:

1. I wanted to have a downloadable resume in the resume button instead of a link to my resume site
2. I wanted to have navigation on the site instead of relying on *scroll-reveal* and scrolling all the way down the page
3. I wanted each nav item to scroll to its id on the page
4. I wanted a hamburger menu to show only on mobile

We'll tackle these in the next few sections.

### 1. Downloadable resume

For this I wanted a pdf file to download when users clicked the `resume` button. I didn't know or understand how people could download files, whether in Gatsby, or HTML in general.

I spent a lot of time in the [Gatsby documentation learning about the filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/importing-assets-into-files/#querying-for-a-file-in-graphql-using-gatsby-source-filesystem) and how to store files. The example showed a GraphQL query but I didn't need GraphQL; this was a static site with no moving parts. The theme did not include GraphQL because it was basic. I could have added all of that but why? I just needed to serve up some images, links, and a pdf; there was no content and no pages.

I went back a couple pages in the docs and found what I needed.

I created a `download` directory in the `src` directory and placed the pdf in there. I then needed a way to download the pdf from that directory.

First, I added the directory to `gatsby-config.js` using the [`gatsby-source-filesystem`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/) plugin:

```jsx
{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
  options: {
    name: `downloads`,
    path: `${__dirname}/src/downloads/`,
  },
}
```
Then I imported the pdf into the `About.jsx` component like so:

```js
// some other imports
import resumeDownload from "../../downloads/resume.pdf";
```
Next, I needed to figure out a way to download a file from a React component.

Initially, I thought I'd need to come up with some convoluted system to do this but it was as simple as using an anchor tag and a couple built-in React props:

```jsx
<span className="d-flex mt-3">
  <a
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    className="cta-btn cta-btn--resume"
    download
    href={resumeDownload}
  >
    Resume
  </a>
</span>
```

Now, when the user clicks the `Resume` button, a copy of my resume will download with some sort of UUID at the end[^1].

### 2. Navigation

Brittany Chiang's portfolio has an interesting navigation bar that I wanted to have. I picked a similar font to the one on her portfolio, and went about building the nav.

In order to get the numbers to be a separate color from the text, I wrapped the numbers in a `<span>` and added a class so that I could target just those spans:

```jsx
<span className="menu-numbers">01.</span> Intro &nbsp;
```

which results in this nice navbar at the top:

        </svg>
       </a>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

It took a little bit of CSS-fu to get it aligned properly, trying to not rely on the `react-bootstrap` CSS that came with the theme[^2].

### 3. Anchor tag scrolling

I forgot how this worked. I did some searching and found that I could add an `id` to the top node in the component tree and target each component that way:

```jsx
<section id="projects">
```

and in the `Nav`

```jsx
<a href="#projects" className="menu-text">
  <span className="menu-numbers">03.</span> Projects &nbsp;
</a>
```

Now, tapping any of those links in the nav take you to the section immediately instead of needing to scroll down the page[^3].


### 4. Creating a responsive hamburger nav

This was *the hardest part* about this project. I didn't use react-bootstrap for the navigation, which would have made this whole endeavor easier. Bootstrap has some utility classes that make adding a hambuger nav easy.

But since I wanted a custom nav, using Bootstrap wasn't going to work. So I built a hamburger nav from scratch. Only, *it was hard*. 

I wasn't sure how to do it in a React app. I did some searching and come across [a tutorial on CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/hamburger-menu-with-a-side-of-react-hooks-and-styled-components/) that gave a step by step guide on how to build a hambuger nav[^4]. The issue was I wanted the hamburger nav to show up *only* when the viewport reached `769px`.

I searched some more and found that I could make the hamburger icon its own component, called `Burger.jsx` and a mobile nav called `MobileNav.jsx`. I used styled-components to create both of these, with code from a video that *also* used the same code in that CSS-Tricks article[^5].

#### Mobile nav

For the mobile nav we have a simple unordered list of menu items that link to the sections ids of the sections of the portfolio:

```jsx
const StyledList = styled.ul`
  list-style: none;
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row nowrap;
  li {
    padding: 18px 10px;
  }

  // More styled component CSS
}
`
const MobileNav = ({ open }) => {
  return (
    <StyledList open={open}>
      <li>
        <a href="#hero" className="menu-text">
          <span className="menu-numbers">01.</span> Intro &nbsp;
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        {" "}
        <a href="#about" className="menu-text">
          <span className="menu-numbers">02.</span> About &nbsp;
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        {" "}
        <a href="#projects" className="menu-text">
          <span className="menu-numbers">03.</span> Projects &nbsp;
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#contact" className="menu-text">
          <span className="menu-numbers">04.</span> Contact &nbsp;
        </a>
      </li>
    </StyledList>
  );
};
```
Here we use the `StyledList` to create the `MobileNav` passing in an `open` prop to the styled list.

Then, in `Burger.jsx` we set `open`'s state using the `useState` hook and setting the intial state to `false`:

```jsx
const Burger = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
  return (
  <>
    <StyledBurger open={open} onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}>
      <div />
      <div />
      <div />
    <MobileNav open={open}/>
    </StyledBurger>
    </>
  );
};
```

When someone taps or clicks on the burger part of the mobile nav, the new state returns true, and the mobile nav opens. Having `MobileNav` outisde `StyledBurger` tripped me up; I kept seeing two menus and no burger when testing on mobile. I moved the `MobileNav` inside the `StyledBurger` which worked and gave me the hamburger menu I wanted. But it was *always there*.

#### Media queries, breakpoints, and defeat

I tried to use media queries to get the hamburger menu to only show when the viewport reached `769px` >. Nothing I tried worked.

I kept searching and, in a moment of defeat, because I spent a couple days trying to figure this out, I used a little library called [react-socks, a React library to render components only on specific viewports](https://github.com/flexdinesh/react-socks). I was able to easily set the breakpoints I needed with an import and some nesting in `App.jsx`:

```jsx
<BreakpointProvider>
  <Breakpoint large up>       
    <Nav />
  </Breakpoint>
  <Breakpoint medium down>
    <Burger />
  </Breakpoint>
</BreakpointProvider>
```

Couldn't get any easier than that.

## Fixes

The navigation jumps a bit when loaded on mobile. I think it may have to do with the library or how I am implementing the mobile nav. In either case, I need to fix it.

There are some content fixes that need to happen as well so I will work on them this weekend.

## Conclusion

I shipped a thing I said I was going to ship and I am proud of that. I am not done shipping new projects. I am starting another this weekend and when that one is finished I want to build a full stack app with Next.js. 

I am a better dev and know much more now. Real artists ship. Now onto the next.

[^1]: I'm assuming it is a UUID; a weird combination of letters and numbers follow after the filename.
[^2]: Which has its own `Navbar` component but I needed a custom one, and all Bootstrap navs are unappealing. I also just wanted it quick and without the need to override stubborn Bootstrap utility classes with `!important` littered everywhere.
[^3]: I am going to wrap each anchor tag *scroll-reveal*'s `<Fade>` component for a smoother scroll experience.
[^4]: And with Hooks!
[^5]: The video creator didn't mention the article. It was a blatant copy of the CSS-Tricks article. Not sure how I feel about that, but will make sure to credit the author of the article and link to the repo.
