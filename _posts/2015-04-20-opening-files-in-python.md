<h1>Opening Files in Python</h1>

So right now I am learning how to open and read files in Python, which is exercise 15. Apparently, it gets super hard around the 30 exercise mark. I am looking forward to the challenge, however.

So I am working through exercise 15. The text file we are to open and read in python contains some arbitrary text. We are still working with argument variables and the command raw_input(), but we’re throwing in the argv

`filename`

with another command

`open`

which just opens the file taking a parameter which returns a value, kind of like raw_input, that you can set to any variable you want, according to pydoc (which is the document system built into python– excellent resource, aside from Dash).

Here is the script I wrote:

```python
from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

txt = open(filename)

print “Here’s your file %r:” % filename
print txt.read()

print “Type the filename again:”
file_again = raw_input(“&gt; ”)

txt_again = open(file_again)

print txt_again.read()
```

Here is my script with the comments I wrote, an annotation that Zed Shaw encourages.

```python
#Grabs the sys module and the argv variable inside that module

from sys import argv

#sets the argument variables to script and filemane&lt;/h1&gt;

script, filename = argv

#when we type the script into the terminal, you have to type in the filename as well that you want to open. This filename must be an arguement variable when you run the python script. txt indicates that it is a txt file. Open(filenmae) calls the argument variable that we specified was ex15_sample.txt and opens it, taking a parameter and returning a value you can set as your own value, much like raw_input

txt = open(filename)

#this line prints out text and opens an formatter which is the argument variable filename.

print “Here’s your file %r:” % filename

#here we call a function on the text file which is read(). To give a file a command you use the dot and and function so txt.read() opens the file without getting any parameters.

print txt.read()

#this line prints this line of text in the script in terminal

print “Type the filename again:”

#this is another prompt with raw_input and the caret assigned to the variable file_again. You must type in the name of the text file again or python will throw an error

file_again = raw_input(“&gt; ”)

#this line uses the open command to open the txt file again

txt_again = open(file_again)

#this line uses the function read() which is part of the command you’re giving the file
txt_again.read(). It will then read and print the contents of the file.

print txt_again.read()
```
