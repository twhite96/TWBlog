You can do a lot on CodePen.

{% notice info %}
 I am going to be doing some blogging about my projects and what I am learning along the way. I said back in 2018 that I was switching things up, but as someone searching for a job, I feel like *all* types of content should go here.

I have been brushing up on my CSS lately[^1] and what I've discovered is that *CodePen* is the perfect place to prototype different concepts.

It's quick and dirty, no real complicated setup needed. Just jump in, create a `div` with some `class` and start firing some CSS in the CSS section. It live updates so you can see your changes almost immediately.
