Wanting to just get the app up and running [^1] , I sat down yesterday and paged through some of the Material Design Lite Docs.

For some reason I never noticed the tab that said, *Templates*. I about cried.

I really didn't feel like getting into too much detail with the HTML and CSS [^2] so this was a welcome addition to what I already had.

Essentially, there was a template called *Text Heavy Website*. Since my app is processing text mainly, I hit the jackpot.

There are still some things I need to add, like the sidebar that will hold the texts that the user stores on the database but *most* of the boilerplate is written.

Good guy Google!

[^1]: Actually working on it, you know.
[^2]: This is just boilerplate; I have *a lot* of HTML and CSS to write as I add more components.
