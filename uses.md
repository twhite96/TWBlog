Seems that a lot of developers are creating these `/uses` pages after discovering [Wes Bos‚Äôs](https://twitter.com/wesbos) [/uses page](http://wesbos.com/uses).

My favorite of these happens to be from [Jon Suh](https://twitter.com/jonsuh). His [/uses page](https://jonsuh.com/uses/) includes a photo, which is what I did here.

I'm _finally_ doing big girl work at a company so I was able to upgrade everything, and will soon upgrade the iMac.

## Gear

Let‚Äôs start with my gear.

- [M1 Mac mini, 1TB storage, 16 GB RAM - Apple](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/)
  - My old iMac's hard disk, a Fusion Drive, was failing because [APFS isn't good on spinning drives](https://blog.macsales.com/43043-using-apfs-on-hdds-and-why-you-might-not-want-to/). The CPU constantly ran high and I couldn't get my work done. I got my old MacBook Pro back from a friend, a 2013 13" but that was much slower than the Fusion Drive 2015 iMac. This thing is a _dream_ compared to those two machines.
- MacBook Pro 13" Late 2013
  - Used for quickie code/blog edits and admin stuff. Too slow for anything else.
- [iPhone 12 Pro 256gb, Silver](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-12-pro/6.1-inch-display-256gb-silver-unlocked)
- [iPad Pro 12.9‚Äù late 2018 256 gb](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1441845-REG/apple_mtfn2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_late.html)
  - This thing is a _beast_. Fast, and the industrial design is my _favorite_ of Apple's iPads to date.
- [Apple Pencil](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1441874-REG/apple_mu8f2am_a_apple_pencil_2nd_generation.html)
  - Still trying to figure out a use for it. I use it for editing videos and podcasts currently.
- [Keychron K2 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=21207598104665)
  - Wanted something a bit smaller and darker as the WASD really showed the grime. The backlighting is a plus. I also use it wired.
- [Audio-Technica ATH-MSR7BK SonicPro Over-Ear High Res Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PEU9CFA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
  - These things sound _amazing_. Seriously good upgrade over my previous Audio-Technica cans, the M50s.
- [beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro 250 ohm Headphones, Gray](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011UB9CQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s02?ie=UTF8&th=1)
  - My daily drivers. All-around comfort and great sound.
- [Drop + HIFIMAN HE4XX Planar Magnetic Headphones](https://drop.com/buy/drop-hifiman-he4xx-planar-magnetic-headphones/reviews)
  - New daily drivers.
- [Steelcase Leap Chair](https://www.madisonseating.com/leap-chair-by-steelcase.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiA5dPuBRCrARIsAJL7oei4kRFt9MUVlZgDlVPmOhr_fOuMQ8AtH-ReGn7nEPBNqE1R1Fxfnj0aAmOsEALw_wcB)
  - I bought this chair open box from Madison Seating because...well...[check out the retail price](https://store.steelcase.com/seating/office-chairs/leap)...
- [Heil PR 40 mic kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U1SG5SW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s02?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
  - I've got a rig setup where I will use this more often than I had.
- [AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/)
- [AirPods Max](https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/)
- [IKEA LINNMON/ALEX Desk](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S99932696/)
  - Every programmer needs a good desk. This one is relatively inexpensive.
- [Tabletop Bulb Base](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CBTKRXW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - Cute lamp that sits on my KALLAX bookshelf with a LIFX bulb in it.
- [HomePods, White](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod/white)
  - Sold my Edifier speakers reluctantly as I really had no place and no use for them üò•. **UPDATE**: I bought another HomePod because of Best Buy's ridiculous sale for $199 to make a stereo pair and damn. I can only turn the volume up to about 3 because it is so loud and just...awesome.
- [KALLAX Shelf unit - black, white - IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/kallax-shelf-unit-black-white-70346927/)

- [M-Audio M-Track C-Series USB Audio Interface](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FFH5XMC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
  - This will drive a lot of audio‚Ä¶as well as record from an XLR mic which I have. Said I was cooking things up.
- [FORS√Ö Work Lamp from IKEA](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70321427/)

  - Where else am I going to put the LIFX Bulbs?
- [Logitech C920S Pro HD Webcam with Privacy Shutter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K95WFWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
  - As I do more webinars, Egghead videos, and yes, soon, streaming, I need a good webcam. I have a [Streaming Amazon List](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/WYX3PZGSUJWN?tag=thatmacnerd-20&sort=default) that I'll be adding to my arsenal in the next couple months.

## Software

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - I only use this anymore for [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/), a VS Code version of [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), both tools for [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/).
- [Nova Editor for macOS](https://nova.app)
  - Yes, I paid $$$ for a text editor. It's feature rich and native to macOS, which I usually don't care about. However, you can't deny the speed increase and easing of stress on your CPU and RAM. Plus, it's _beautiful_.
- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
  - I will never use a terminal without this installed.
- [Boom 3D](http://www.globaldelight.com/boom3d/index.php)
  - This makes everything sound _amazing_.
- Chrome
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)
  - Workflows make this my favorite app.I can‚Äôt live without it. You can find my workflows [here](https://trw.im/alfred). I have way too many, I admit.
- Text Expander
- [Todoist](https://todosit.com) for tasks.[^2]
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so) for Project management.[^3]
- [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/)
- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) for scheduling. I pay for the premium version.
- [Sip for Mac](https://sipapp.io/) for a color picker
- [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm)
  - As I get into making egghead lessons and more screencasts for tiffany.blog, I need a heavy duty piece of software to do so. Screenflow fits the bill.
- [StreamLabs OBS Software for Mac](https://streamlabs.com/)
  - Best OBS client on the Mac.
- [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/)
  - This is how I share bugs and other things with devs and dev teams. Also an easy way to make a gif of a feature or bug on my Mac.
- [Setapp](https://setapp.com/)
  - It finally has enough utilities to make it worth the subscription price for me.

## Home Server
Yeah I am running a home server of sorts, as my fascination with Home Assistant, InfoSec, and networking/network security continues to grow.

Below is a list of the hardware I use for the rack. Click the details button to see the softare I am running on the network for server and IoT purposes.

- [CyberPower Smart App LCD UPS System, 1500VA/900W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack Tower](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HDODQYS?psc=1)
  - Having battery backup is important. This way if there is a black or brownout, you have enough juice to keep your system running until you can shut it down properly.
- [CyberPower CPS1215RMS Surge Protector, 120V/15A, 12 Outlets, 15ft Power Cord, 1U Rackmount Black](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00077INZU?psc=1)
  - Ran out of outlets in the UPS
- [TP-Link 16 Port Gigabit Switch Smart Managed Switch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0797KPRPK?psc=1)
  - I have a couple of these TP-Link Switches, one unmanaged and another smaller managed switch. I want to separate different devices on different networks using a VLAN and other things.
- [NavePoint 9U Wall Mount Network Server 19 Inch IT Cabinet Rack Enclosure Glass Door Lock](https://www.amazon.com/NavePoint-Network-Server-Cabinet-Enclosure/dp/B01FKOW4LS/144-7175663-3493110?psc=1)
  - This is where I hold all the rack equipment
- [Synology 4 bay NAS DiskStation DS920+ Diskless 4-bay; 4GB DDR4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087Z34F3R?psc=1)
  - I *love* this thing. I have Homebridge running on it, I have Plex serving up stuff on it, and a dev instance of Home Assistant as well as a few Docker containers. Trying to figure out how to deploy a production app in a container[^4] and am using this to test out a few containers with small node apps in them.
- [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8gb)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08R87H4RR?psc=1)
  - I have a production Home Assistant instance running on this.
- [CanaKit Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Premium-Clear-Supply/dp/B07BC7BMHY)
  - I am running Pi-hole and WireGuard on this however I don't understand most of how Wireguard works so I bought a Swiss VPN with no ties to any government[^5]

## I Use a lot of software, I admit

But I use ALL OF IT.

So this is my setup and what I am currently using. You can show me your dev setup on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tiffanywhitedev).

[^1]: The latency of the HomePods when watching video on my Mac was atrocious. I bought my favorite bookshelf speakers again and couldn't be happier. Still have the HomePods when I want to have apartment filling sound with AirPlay 2 Sonos Play:5 2nd Gen, Sonos One, and the two black HomePods I use as home theater audio with my Apple TV. It's a party for sure. üòâ
[^2]: This is the only task manager that I actually look at and use. It is _that_ beautiful, simple, and it has impressed me far more than any task manager in recent memory.
[^3]: This is such a deep app and I am in love with it. After avoiding it because I was a heavy user of Evernote and quite liked it, there were things that annoyed me about it. Everyone talked about this app, Notion and I signed up. Been using it for two weeks and I have paid the subscription. It's that good. Still setting it up but here's my [dashboard](http://trw.im/dash).
[^4]: Though *not* from my NAS....
[^5]: No logs kept either. It's kinda slow though. Some things don't work on my network when it is enabled. I think a lot of it has to do with Fios being shit for a lot of folks, including myself, lately.
[^6]: When grabbing the link for WireGuard I found this repo which is just ü§åüèΩ [trailofbits/algo Set up a personal VPN in the cloud](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo)
