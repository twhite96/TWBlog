Seems that a lot of developers are creating these `/uses` pages after discovering [Wes Bos‚Äôs](https://twitter.com/wesbos) [/uses page](http://wesbos.com/uses).

My favorite of these happens to be from [Jon Suh](https://twitter.com/jonsuh). His [/uses page](https://jonsuh.com/uses/) includes a photo, which is what I did here.

I'm *finally* doing big girl work at a company so I was able to upgrade everything, and will soon upgrade the iMac.

## Gear

Let‚Äôs start with my gear.

- [Mac mini - Apple](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/)
	- My old iMac's hard disk, a Fusion Drive, was failing because [APFS isn't good on spinning drives](https://blog.macsales.com/43043-using-apfs-on-hdds-and-why-you-might-not-want-to/). The CPU constantly ran high and I couldn't get my work done. I got my old MacBook Pro back from a friend, a 2013 13" but that was much slower than the Fusion Drive 2015 iMac. This thing is a *dream* compared to those two machines.
- [iPhone XS Max 256gb, Gold](https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/apple-iphone-8-plus?color=spacegray&memory=256gb) [^1]
- [iPad Pro 12.9‚Äù late 2018 256 gb](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1441845-REG/apple_mtfn2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_late.html)
  - This thing is a *beast*. Fast, and the industrial design is my *favorite* of Apple's iPads to date.
- [Brydge Keyboard for 2018 iPad Pro](https://www.brydge.com/pages/2018-ipad-pro-keyboard-interest-form)
	- Decent but fragile as hell.
- [Apple Pencil](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1441874-REG/apple_mu8f2am_a_apple_pencil_2nd_generation.html)
	- Still trying to figure out a use for it. I use it for editing videos and podcasts currently.
- [WASD Custom Keys Mechanical Keyboard, Mac layout, MX Cherry Blue](https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/wasd-v3-87-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html?wasd_customizer_id=1ea3e45f691d80ec3f30739ce3eb5b7b773da6539543b3c4de2b85e1503a4829)
	- Got my "brand" colors. Next is a Keychron, RGB backlighting...*Down the rabbit hole I go...*
-  [Audio-Technica ATH-MSR7BK SonicPro Over-Ear High Res Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PEU9CFA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
	- These things sound *amazing*. Seriously good upgrade over my  previous Audio-Technica cans, the M50s.
-  [beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro 250 ohm Headphones, Gray](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011UB9CQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s02?ie=UTF8&th=1)
   -  My daily drivers. All-around comfort and great sound.
- [Steelcase Leap Chair](https://www.madisonseating.com/leap-chair-by-steelcase.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiA5dPuBRCrARIsAJL7oei4kRFt9MUVlZgDlVPmOhr_fOuMQ8AtH-ReGn7nEPBNqE1R1Fxfnj0aAmOsEALw_wcB)
  - I bought this chair open box from Madison Seating because...well...[check out the retail price](https://store.steelcase.com/seating/office-chairs/leap)...
- [Heil PR 40 mic kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U1SG5SW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s02?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
	- I've got a rig setup where I will use this more often than I had.
- [AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/)
- [IKEA LINNMON/ALEX Desk](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S99932696/)
	- Every programmer needs a good desk. This one is relatively inexpensive.
- [Tabletop Bulb Base](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CBTKRXW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - Cute lamp that sits on my KALLAX bookshelf with a LIFX bulb in it.
- [HomePods, White](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod/white)
  - Sold my Edifier speakers reluctantly as I really had no place and no use for them üò•. **UPDATE**: I bought another HomePod because of Best Buy's ridiculous sale for $199 to make a stereo pair and damn. I can only turn the volume up to about 3 because it is so loud and just...awesome.
- [KALLAX Shelf unit - black, white - IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/kallax-shelf-unit-black-white-70346927/)
- [LG 4K Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LPNKFK0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
	- Three monitors are better than one.

	- *The best mouse I have ever used* is an understatement. Better than the original *in every way*.
-  [M-Audio M-Track C-Series USB Audio Interface](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FFH5XMC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
	- This will drive a lot of audio‚Ä¶as well as record from an XLR mic which I have. Said I was cooking things up.
- [Material Dock by Studio Neat](https://www.studioneat.com/products/dock)
  - This is the Qi, Lightining, and Apple Watch one. Looks really nice.
- [FORS√Ö Work Lamp from IKEA](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70321427/)
- [Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Dot-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-Alexa-Black/dp/B01DFKC2SO/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?sr=8-1-spons&ie=UTF8&tag=thatmacnerd-20&keywords=Amazon%2BEcho%2BDots%2B%25282nd%2BGen&psc=1&qid=1519870529)

	- Yeah. I am on the bandwagon. I am a programmer and I want my desk to feel like a rocket ship. Sue me.
- [LIFX A19 Wi-fi Smart LED Bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KY02MS8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
- [Anchor Pro by ElevationLab](https://www.elevationlab.com/products/the-anchor-pro)
  - Great under the desk, hide your cables, headphone rack.
- [IKEA Holmo 46" Floor Lamps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070PBVWO/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_2?smid=A22ARMH4S21UOS&tag=thatmacnerd-20&psc=1&ie=UTF8)
	- Where else am I going to put the LIFX Bulbs?
- [Logitech C920S Pro HD Webcam with Privacy Shutter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K95WFWM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
  - As I do more webinars, Egghead videos, and yes, soon, streaming, I need a good webcam. I have a [Streaming Amazon List](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/WYX3PZGSUJWN?tag=thatmacnerd-20&sort=default) that I'll be adding to my arsenal in the next couple months.

  - For the new monitor.

## Software

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
	- It does everything I need it to do. Atom was nice and had a lot of features but goddamn it‚Äôs hella slow. So I went back to VS Code [^2] and couldn‚Äôt be happier.
- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
	- I will never use a terminal without this installed.
- [Boom 3D](http://www.globaldelight.com/boom3d/index.php)
	- This makes everything sound *amazing*.
- Xcode
- Chrome
- PopClip
	- Using PopClip is a lifesaver. When it doesn‚Äôt work I am lost.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
	- Workflows make this my favorite app. I can‚Äôt live without it. You can find my workflows [here](https://cl.ly/1W2N1P1z213i/Alfred_workflows.jpg). I have way too many, I admit.
- Text Expander
- [Adobe CC, All Apps](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html)
  - Dipping my toe into YouTube, and hopefully having a co-host for the [Good First Issue Podcast](https://goodfirstissue.org/) means I need a pro suite of tools.
- [BetterSnapTool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS) is my choice for window snapping.
- [Quiver](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quiver-the-programmers-notebook/id866773894?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS) is a programmers notebook to take notes with syntax highlighting and markdown support. Supports many languages [^3].
- [Tweetbot 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-2-for-twitter/id557168941?mt=12)
  - The 3rd iteration hogs CPU and memory. If it was more efficient I'd use it; the ability to add gifs right in the app is killer. But it freezes constantly. So I use v2.
- [Station](https://getstation.com/).
  - This is a chat aggregator that is *like Franz on steroids* and *free*. Honestly don't know why it's free but I know the hammer will come down on it, as it always does with SaaS companies.
- [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for tasks.[^4]
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so) for Project management.[^5]
- [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
  - Nothing beats it for note-taking and archiving.
- [Fantastical 2](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) for scheduling
- [Dash 4](https://kapeli.com/dash). [^6]
- [Sip for Mac](https://sipapp.io/) for a color picker
- [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm)
  - As I get into making egghead lessons and more screencasts for tiffany.blog, I need a heavy duty piece of software to do so. Screenflow fits the bill.
- [StreamLabs OBS Software for Mac](https://streamlabs.com/)
  - Best OBS client on the Mac.
- [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/)
  - This is how I share bugs and other things with devs and dev teams. Also an easy way to make a gif of a feature or bug on my Mac.
- [Setapp](https://setapp.com/)
  - It finally has enough utilities to make it worth the subscription price for me.

## I Use a lot of software, I admit

But I use ALL OF IT.

So this is my setup and what I am currently using. You can show me your dev setup on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tiffanywhitedev).


[^1]: Got the gold and this will be my last iPhone for a while. No need to upgrade yearly as these phones are more than capable of lasting a couple years.
[^2]: I did have Ulysses installed. They even featured me on [their blog](https://ulyssesapp.com/blog/2018/04/tiffany-r-white/). I mainly used it to post to WordPress and since I am on Gatsby and Jekyll for everything now I don't need the subscription. I feel really bad. But now I use VSCode for this and a couple scripts to post here and my other blogs.
[^3]: Even brainfuck!
[^4]: This is the only task manager that I actually look at and use. It is *that* beautiful, simple, and it has impressed me far more than any task manager in recent memory.
[^5]: This is such a deep app and I am in love with it. After avoiding it because I was a heavy user of Evernote and quite liked it, there were things that annoyed me about it. Everyone talked about this app, Notion and I signed up. Been using it for two weeks and I have paid the subscription. It's that good. Still setting it up but here's my [dashboard](https://cl.ly/44d974d179b2/Screenshot-2020-01-15_09-08-14_PM-1-1.png).
[^6]: Offline docs ftw! Plus much more.
