Seems that a lot of developers are creating these `/uses` pages after discovering [Wes Bos’s](https://twitter.com/wesbos) [/uses page](http://wesbos.com/uses).

My favorite of these happens to be from [Jon Suh](https://twitter.com/jonsuh). His [/uses page](https://jonsuh.com/uses/) includes a photo, which is what I did here.

While I was interning, I had enough money to make my desk setup look *sick* as Wes and Scott would say. So some of the stuff below will change.

## Gear

Let’s start with my gear.

- [27” iMac, Retina 5K, late 2015](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1190385-REG/apple_mk462ll_a_27_imac_with_retina.html)
- [iPhone Xs Max, Gold](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xs/6.5-inch-display-256gb-gold-unlocked#01,20,32,41,60) [^1]

	- I moved some of my writing workflow over to this iPad with this case. It is heavy and bulky but cheaper than Apple’s case.
- [Apple Pencil](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1190545-REG/apple_mk0c2am_a_pencil_for_ipad_pro.html?sts=pi)
	- I hardly use it but am trying to figure out uses for it.

	- I will never type on another iMac keyboard. **Ever**. I fly on the keyboard DEV loaned me during my internship. Not going back to desktop chicklet keys.
-  [Audio-Technica ATH-MSR7BK SonicPro Over-Ear High Res Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PEU9CFA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

	- I bought this when I thought I was serious about pod and screencasting. Heh. I still do a short show for Productivity in Tech.

As you can see I finally moved into my new place. My cable management game is all off but it is what it is[^3].

- [IKEA LINNMON/ALEX Desk](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S99932696/)
	- Every programmer needs a good desk. This one is relatively inexpensive.
- [Edifier R1280T Powered Bookshelf Speakers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016P9HJIA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
	- *Finally* picked up some decent speakers. These were the same price as the Mackies I was going to get only these look better.
- [iXCC RCA to 3.5 mm cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019D048XC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

- [LG 4K Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LPNKFK0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

	- Since I will be moving soon, some of these items I haven’t used yet. This is one of those items. Everyone raves about this mouse so I want to give it a go.
- [Aenfor aluminum gaming mousepad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074L6Z5P3/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

	- This will drive a lot of audio…as well as record from an XLR mic which I have. Said I was cooking things up. [I am](https://15minutesindev.io/home/).
- [MAKETECH Swivel Under-the-Desk USB 3.0 Hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWIIAOR/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s01?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

	- I got this as a companion to my Echo 1st Gen which you can find below. I wanted one for my room so I got the cheapest Echo I could find.
	- [Amazon Echo 1st Gen](http://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B076PSZL29/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=thatmacnerd-20)
- [LIFX Z Wi-Fi Smart LED Strip Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073168F4Y/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
	- Yeah. I am on the bandwagon. I am a programmer and I want my desk to feel like a rocket ship. Sue me.
- [LIFX A19 Wi-fi Smart LED Bulb x2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KY02MS8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

	- Where else am I going to put the LIFX Bulbs?

## Software

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
	- It does everything I need it to do. Atom was nice and had a lot of features but goddamn it’s hella slow. So I went back to VS Code [^4] and couldn’t be happier.
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
	- Back to iTerm. Multiple panels ftw.
- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
	- I will never use a terminal without this installed.
- [Mac CLI](https://github.com/guarinogabriel/Mac-CLI)
	- Control pretty much every function your Mac can do, plus updating all packages across package managers, ssh, MySQL etc, right from your command line. Excellent tool.
- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) for UI design
- [Boom 3D](http://www.globaldelight.com/boom3d/index.php)
	- This makes everything sound *amazing*.
- [Timing 2](https://timingapp.com/)
	- This is how I can find out how much time I spend on Twitter.
- Xcode
- Chrome
- [Transmit 5 for Mac](https://www.panic.com/transmit/)
	- There are cheaper, free, FTP clients out there but my first text editor was Coda and I liked it so much I bought Panic’s FTP client. It looks good and functions quite well. I moved on from Coda when I became “serious”.
- nvAlt
	- Brett Terpstra made a fork of Notational Velocity’s plain text note app and I use it for quick notes.
- PopClip
	- Using PopClip is a lifesaver. When it doesn’t work I am lost.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
	- Workflows make this my favorite app. I can’t live without it. You can find my workflows [here](https://cl.ly/1W2N1P1z213i/Alfred_workflows.jpg). I have way too many, I admit.
- Text Expander
- [Affinity Designer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/affinity-designer/id824171161?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS)
	- I am trying to learn how to use this better.
- [Affinity Photo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/affinity-photo/id824183456?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS)
	- Definitely replaces Adobe CC for me.
- Amphetamine to keep my Mac awake
- Spark for email that isn’t Gmail
- [Shell Runner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shell-runner/id689441182?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS)
	- To test shell scripts
- [BetterSnapTool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS) is my choice for window snapping.
- [Expressions](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expressions/id913158085?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS) to test regular expressions
- [‎Tweetbot 3 for Twitter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter/id1384080005?mt=12)
- [Franz](https://meetfranz.com/). This is a chat aggregator. Open source and wayyyyyy better looking than Rambox.
- [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for tasks.[^5]
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so) for Project management.[^6]
- [Fantastical 2](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) for scheduling
- [Dash 4](https://kapeli.com/dash). [^7]
- [Sip for Mac](https://sipapp.io/) for a color picker

## I Use a lot of software, I admit

But I use ALL OF IT.

So this is my setup and what I am currently using. You can show me your dev setup on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TiffanyW_412).

[^1]: My jealousy of the X this past year meant that I was upgrading but, since the phones seem less and less substantial, I probably won't upgrade next year unless it is something compelling.
[^2]: Since starting a podcast and YouTube channel for one of my side projects, I decided to move some of my production work and blogging to the new iPad Pro.
[^3]: Not a YouTuber so it is kind of a mess.
[^4]: I did have Ulysses installed. They even featured me on [their blog](https://ulyssesapp.com/blog/2018/04/tiffany-r-white/). I mainly used it to post to WordPress and since I am on Jekyll for everything now I don't need the subscription. I feel really bad. But now I use VSCode for this and a couple scripts to post here and my other blogs.
[^5]: This is the only task manager that I actually look at and use. It is *that* beautiful, simple, and it has impressed me far more than any task manager in recent memory.
[^6]: This is such a deep app and I am in love with it. After avoiding it because I was a heavy user of Evernote and quite liked it, there were things that annoyed me about it. Everyone talked about this app, Notion and I signed up. Been using it for two weeks and I have paid the subscription. It's that good. Still setting it up but here's my [dashboard](https://cl.ly/27c125f6594f/Screenshot-2018-10-31_11-25-37_PM.png).
[^7]: Offline docs ftw! Plus much more.
